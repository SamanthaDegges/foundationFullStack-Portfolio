notes day 2 with James Stone

On Design Process
-always build generalized 'broad brush stroke' before creating the detailed 'pixel perfect' layout.
-some components weight the site down, particularly the off canvas and the nav bar.
-create your own circle shaped div by adjusting radius in css
-svg and radial dials can do more than css
-Try and use just a few header sizes, to keep a consistency in your style for this page or project.
-When you float right, make sure your li are in the reverse order to get expected result.
-clear fix is when you empty child elements of a row when you are using float, to 'clear the float.'




FOUNDATIONS
In Foundations, a panel is jsut a bg color on a div and it sets padding. PUtting a panel above your row makes the background panel part span.
This is a nice chunking effect that cuts up the overall pages well.

You can use the default HTML5 <header></header> tags for your header.

apostrophe:

-
h1 {
  margin-bottom: rem-calc(15); 1rem == 16px; Put this in the bottom of your sass file, using px or rem, etc.
}

Avoid global CSS pollution by using leadin
example:    h1.leadin{ margin-bottom: rem-calc(45); }

 or with a view-specific css :

 .view-login {
 h1 { margin-bottom: rem-calc(45); }
 }
Use classes to create makeshift modules. This way, you can have any elements within a div take on this class. Example: cards
 Set a class in your css to make all images wtihin a certain class tobe rounded divs.
 ex:

  .rounded {
    img {border-radius: 9999px; }
  }

  To make a button expand to the width of its parent element, ad the class = "expand" to it!
