Things I like in portfolio sites :
1) when hoer triggers color and the inactive state is a black and white image
2) animations! I like animations that are not distracting, and ones that do not occur upon scrolling
3) i love the parallax effect or the background as a static image.
4) I like a efective color palette with consistency
5) i like chunky, balanced, consistent spacing
6) I like uniqueness, not the standard layout that is sooo "typical" and bootstrappy. It need to be clean and modern but different.
7) I do not like typical tradiitonal buttons. THeyre boring. I want clear UX and calls to action but noooo default buttons.
8) mobile responsive to taps or modals.
9) I like abstract background images or textured interesting images/patterns. No hipster, typical blurred images, or same old stuff.
10)I really like multipiece and span/responsive footers like the one on herokus website.
11) I really like sites that are not afraid to be different, that are fun and have imaginative components, liek a 3d logo, a tasteful infographic that is a gif, and a image with a spin on the colors. Sometimes, even a theme that is seasonal, mood based or time-of-day based, can be a fun wacky option on some sites.
