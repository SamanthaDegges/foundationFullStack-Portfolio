to add :
1) when hover triggers color and the inactive state is a black and white image
2) animationsthat are not distracting, and ones that do not occur upon scrolling
3) a static bg image.
4) effective color palette with consistency
5) chunky, balanced, consistent spacing
6)
7) 3d logo,or a toggle theme that is seasonal.
8) mobile responsive to taps or modals.
9) textured images/patterns.
10)I really like multipiece and span/responsive footers like the one on herokus website.
